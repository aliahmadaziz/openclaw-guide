## 2. Manual End-to-End Test

The automated script validates the infrastructure. Now let's validate the **bot responds**.

### 2.1 Send a Test Message

From your phone (the one paired with WhatsApp):

1. Open WhatsApp
2. Send a message to your bot number:
   ```
   Hey, are you alive?
   ```

3. Wait 5-10 seconds

✅ **Verify:** Bot responds with a natural reply

### 2.2 Test a Command

Send:
```
What's the current UTC time?
```

✅ **Verify:** Bot responds with the correct time

### 2.3 Test File Access

Send:
```
Read SOUL.md and tell me what your primary directive is
```

✅ **Verify:** Bot reads the file and summarizes

**If any test fails**, proceed to the Troubleshooting section below.

## 3. Troubleshooting Reference

Quick lookup for common issues across all parts.

### 3.1 Quick Reference Table

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Can't SSH to server** | SSH service not running | `systemctl restart sshd` |
| **"Permission denied (publickey)"** | SSH key not added to server | Re-add key: `ssh-copy-id root@SERVER_IP` |
| **Gateway won't start** | Port conflict or bad config | Check logs: `openclaw gateway logs` |
| **WhatsApp disconnected** | QR code expired or phone offline | Re-pair: `openclaw gateway restart`, scan QR |
| **Bot doesn't respond** | Gateway stopped or model API issue | Check status: `openclaw gateway status` |
| **"Model rate limit"** | Too many requests | Wait 60s, or switch to fallback model |
| **Webhook not receiving** | Tunnel down or server crashed | Restart: `systemctl restart cloudflared moltbot-webhook` |
| **Backup not running** | Cron misconfigured | Check: `crontab -l`, verify paths |
| **Token expired** | Google OAuth needs refresh | Re-auth: `scripts/google-reauth.py` |
| **"Permission denied" errors** | Wrong file ownership | Fix: `chown -R root:root /root/clawd` |

### 3.2 Top 10 Common Issues

#### 1. WhatsApp Keeps Disconnecting
**Symptom:** Bot works for a few hours, then stops responding.

**Cause:** Phone went offline, or WhatsApp logged out.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check gateway logs
openclaw gateway logs | grep -i whatsapp

# If disconnected, restart and re-pair
openclaw gateway restart
```
*Keep your phone online and WhatsApp open during initial setup.*

---

#### 2. Gateway Fails to Start
**Symptom:** `openclaw gateway status` shows "failed" or "inactive (dead)"

**Cause:** Usually bad `openclaw.json` syntax or missing API key.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check the exact error
openclaw gateway logs

# Validate JSON syntax
cat ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json | jq .

# If syntax error, edit and fix
nano ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json

# Restart
openclaw gateway restart
```

---

#### 3. "Model not found" or API Errors
**Symptom:** Bot responds with "Model error" or doesn't respond at all.

**Cause:** Invalid API key, wrong model name, or API service down.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check logs for specific error
openclaw gateway logs | grep -i error

# Verify API key is set correctly in openclaw.json
cat ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json | jq '.agents.defaults.model'

# Test API key manually (for Anthropic)
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5","max_tokens":10,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

---

#### 4. Webhook Returns 404 or 502
**Symptom:** Webhook URL returns error when visited.

**Cause:** Cloudflare tunnel not running, or webhook server crashed.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check both services
systemctl status cloudflared-tunnel
systemctl status moltbot-webhook

# Check tunnel config
cat ~/.cloudflared/config.yml

# Restart both
systemctl restart cloudflared
systemctl restart moltbot-webhook

# Test local webhook
curl http://127.0.0.1:8088/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok"}
```

---

#### 5. Backups Not Running
**Symptom:** No recent backups in Google Drive, or cron emails about failures.

**Cause:** Cron not scheduled, rclone not configured, or script permissions wrong.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check cron is scheduled
crontab -l | grep backup

# Test hourly backup manually
/root/clawd/backup.sh

# Test nightly backup manually
/root/clawd/scripts/nightly-backup.sh

# Check rclone config
rclone listremotes
# Should show: gdrive:

# Check recent backup files
ls -lh /root/openclaw-backups/
```

---

#### 6. Google OAuth Token Expired
**Symptom:** Calendar sync fails, or "invalid_grant" errors.

**Cause:** Token expired or revoked.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Re-authenticate
cd /root/clawd
python3 scripts/google-reauth.py

# Follow the OAuth flow in browser
# New token will be saved to ~/.clawdbot/google/token.json
```

---

#### 7. Firewall Blocking Legitimate Traffic
**Symptom:** Can't access webhook, or bot can't reach external APIs.

**Cause:** UFW rule too restrictive.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check current rules
ufw status numbered

# Allow outbound traffic (should be default, but verify)
ufw default allow outgoing

# If you need to allow a specific inbound port:
ufw allow PORT_NUMBER/tcp

# Reload
ufw reload
```
*Never open unnecessary inbound ports. Only SSH should be allowed.*

---

#### 8. Out of Disk Space
**Symptom:** Logs say "no space left on device", services fail.

**Cause:** Logs filling disk, or too many backups.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check disk usage
df -h

# Find large directories
du -sh /var/log/* | sort -h
du -sh /root/* | sort -h

# Clear old logs
journalctl --vacuum-time=7d

# Delete old backups (keep last 7 days)
find /root/openclaw-backups/ -type f -mtime +7 -delete
```

---

#### 9. Node.js Version Mismatch
**Symptom:** OpenClaw install fails, or runtime errors.

**Cause:** Wrong Node.js version installed.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check current version
node --version

# If not v22.x, reinstall
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs

# Verify
node --version
# Should show: v22.x.x
```

---

#### 10. CrowdSec Blocking Legitimate IPs
**Symptom:** Can't SSH from your IP, or bot's outbound requests blocked.

**Cause:** CrowdSec false positive.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check decisions (active bans)
cscli decisions list

# If your IP is banned, unban it
cscli decisions delete --ip YOUR_IP

# Whitelist your IP permanently
cscli decisions add --ip YOUR_IP --duration 999999h --type captcha

# Or disable bouncer temporarily
systemctl stop crowdsec-firewall-bouncer
```

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "profiles": {
      "anthropic:default": {
        "provider": "anthropic",
        "mode": "claude-code"

}
```

### 4.2 Key Field Explanations

| Field (dot path) | Purpose | Example Value |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| `auth.profiles` | API credentials per provider | See auth section |
| `agents.defaults.model.primary` | Primary AI model | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` |
| `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks` | Backup models (array) | `["google/gemini-2.5-pro"]` |
| `agents.defaults.contextTokens` | Max context window | `200000` (200K) |
| `agents.defaults.workspace` | Agent workspace directory | `/root/clawd` |
| `agents.defaults.heartbeat.every` | Heartbeat interval | `"45m"` |
| `agents.defaults.subagents.model.primary` | Sub-agent model | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` |
| `agents.list[].agentDir` | Agent workspace path | `/root/clawd` |
| `channels.whatsapp` | WhatsApp channel config | `{"enabled": true}` |
| `tools.deny` | Blocked tool names | `["memory_search"]` |
| `gateway.mode` | Gateway mode | `"local"` |

### 4.3 Model Configuration

**Recommended Tiers:**

| Use Case | Model | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Main session | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` | Upgrade to `claude-opus-4-6` on Max plan |
| Sub-agents | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` | Background workers |
| Cron jobs | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` | Set per-job via `--model` |
| Fallback | `google/gemini-2.5-pro` | Free tier or Google One |

**Important:** Set `contextTokens` to the **smallest** context window in your chain. Most models support 200K, so `200000` is a safe default.

### 4.4 Useful Config Commands

```bash
# Get any config value
openclaw config get agents.defaults.model.primary

# Set a config value
openclaw config set agents.defaults.model.primary "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"

# Unset a config value
openclaw config unset tools.deny

# Or edit the full config file directly
nano ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

## 5. What's Next?

You've built the infrastructure. Now make it **yours**.

### 5.1 Customize Your Persona

Edit `/root/clawd/SOUL.md` to define your bot's personality:

```bash
nano /root/clawd/SOUL.md
```

**Suggested sections:**
- **Core directive:** What's your bot's primary purpose?
- **Tone:** Formal? Casual? Sarcastic?
- **Boundaries:** What should it refuse to do?
- **Expertise:** What domains is it expert in?

**Example:**
```markdown
# SOUL.md

## Primary Directive
I am MyBot, your executive assistant. My purpose is to:
1. Manage his calendar and priorities
2. Handle research and data gathering
3. Draft communications
4. Monitor systems and alert on issues

## Tone
Professional but warm. I use first person ("I checked the calendar").
Direct and concise — no fluff.

## Boundaries
I do not:
- Make financial decisions without confirmation
- Send external messages without review
- Delete data without asking
```

### 5.2 Build Daily Rhythms

Create routines using cron jobs:

**Morning Brief (9am UTC):**
```python
# /root/clawd/scripts/morning-brief.py
# - Check calendar for today
# - Summarize unread emails
# - Review yesterday's memory log
# - Send via WhatsApp
```

**Standup (10am UTC, weekdays only):**
```python
# /root/clawd/scripts/standup.py
# - List today's scheduled tasks
# - Check active projects
# - Suggest priorities
```

**Evening Wrap (6pm UTC):**
```python
# /root/clawd/scripts/evening-wrap.py
# - Summarize what happened today
# - Write to daily memory log
# - Prep tomorrow's agenda
```

Add to `openclaw.json`:
```json
"crons": [
  {
    "name": "morning-brief",
    "schedule": "0 9 * * *",
    "command": "python3 /root/clawd/scripts/morning-brief.py",
    "deliverTo": "whatsapp"
  },
  {
    "name": "standup",
    "schedule": "0 10 * * 1-5",
    "command": "python3 /root/clawd/scripts/standup.py",
    "deliverTo": "whatsapp"
  },
  {
    "name": "evening-wrap",
    "schedule": "0 18 * * *",
    "command": "python3 /root/clawd/scripts/evening-wrap.py",
    "deliverTo": "whatsapp"
  }
]
```

### 5.3 Email Integration

**Option 1: AgentMail (Dead Simple)**
1. Sign up at [agentmail.to](https://agentmail.to)
2. Get your bot email: `yourname@agentmail.to`
3. Configure webhook in AgentMail settings
4. Point to: `https://webhook.yourdomain.com/agentmail/YOUR_SECRET`
5. Bot receives emails, processes via event queue

**Option 2: Gmail API (Full Control)**
1. Already set up if you completed Part 3
2. Use `scripts/gmail-check.py` to poll inbox
3. Run via cron every 15 minutes
4. Process new emails, summarize, alert

### 5.4 Create Custom Skills

Skills are reusable tools your bot can invoke.

**Example: Weather Lookup**

```python
# /root/clawd/skills/weather.py
import requests
import sys

def get_weather(city):
    api_key = "YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY"
    url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={api_key}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    
    temp_k = data['main']['temp']
    temp_c = temp_k - 273.15
    description = data['weather'][0]['description']
    
    return f"{city}: {temp_c:.1f}°C, {description}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    city = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "Your City"
    print(get_weather(city))
```

**How to use:**
1. Save to `/root/clawd/skills/weather.py`
2. Make executable: `chmod +x /root/clawd/skills/weather.py`
3. Document in `/root/clawd/TOOLS.md`:
   ```markdown
   ## Weather
   `python3 skills/weather.py "City Name"`
   Returns current weather for any city.
   ```
4. Bot can now call it: `python3 skills/weather.py "London"`
